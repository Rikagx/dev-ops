## Production "State"

<br>

What are some questions that we should ask once our code is ready for production?

<br>

-   Where is it deployed?

-   Is it secure and accessible?

-   Does it scale?

-   Is it tested?

## Data architecture and auth

## Choosing the right presentation layer

## Choosing a REST API

![](images/what_is_rest_api.png)

::: notes
application programming interface clients to communicate with a server. Rest API is a kind of web-service which stores and retrieves necessary data. It provides great flexibility to developers since it does not need any dependent code libraries to access the web-services. Amongst the many protocols supported by REST, the most common one is HTTP. When a request is sent from the client using a HTTPRequest, a corresponding response is sent from the server using HTTPResponse.
